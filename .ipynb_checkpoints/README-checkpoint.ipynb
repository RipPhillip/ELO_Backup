    "After this, I used a function to generate an Elo statistic for each team. Elo takes in the final score of each game, when and where it was played.  Teams are given a number of points based on a win or a loss.  Winning away games and winning by large margins allot more points to a team.  For reference, an average team's Elo is 1500.  [Fivethirtyeight.com](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nba/#lakers) used this metric to do an interactive time series on every NBA team to show their relative strengths throughout the history of each franchise.  Columns for **Home Team Elo** before and after, and **Away Team Elo** before and after were attached to each team and would be calculated on a rolling basis throughout each season.\n",

    "The final step was to average out each team's last 10 games at any given point in a season.  This was performed through functions on each dataframe, basic and advanced as well as on each teams' Elo.  The reason that this is done is for the classification models.  If the statistics from each game log, home team and away team, were to run against each other, the model would look at one or two metrics only to determine the outcome of games.  This was realized after running through some models without aggregating the teams' statistics and seeing that the model would only take into account **Offensive Rating** and **Defensive Rating** for advanced statistics and **Field Goals** for basic statistics.  Averaging out the last 10 games worth of statistics and pitting them against the other teams' is vital.  "

    "There is more that can be done with this project as our understanding of basketball grows.  At some point, defensive metrics will be good enough to include in models so as to get an even better idea of how to predict the outcome of games, let alone gain a better understanding in general.  Something I'd like to do with the project is to also merge in data from the playoffs for each of the years my dataframe spans.  A final piece that I can implement is a dataframe that shows the actual score versus the predicted score and see just how far off each predicted score was."
